                <h2 class="h4">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any translated copies of the Terms of Service, the English version shall prevail.</p>
                <p>Thanks for having a look at our Terms of Service! For us transparency is very important, so our full Terms of Service are set out below, but to make it easier for you here is a short overview of the most important points: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most of busuu can be used completely free of charge. </li>
                    <li>To access the language courses on busuu you must register for a free account. </li>
                    <li>You have the option to purchase a Premium membership. With a Premium membership you have access to additional learning functions such as grammar units, certificates, etc. This is just an option; you can use busuu as basic member completely for free. If you purchase a Premium membership, it will renew automatically for the initial time period purchased, but you can cancel it at any time by going to "Settings" and then “Subscription” within the Site. If you purchased through a third party such as an app store, your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that third party (in addition to these Terms). To cancel your subscription, you must cancel directly with that third party. You will then still enjoy Premium access until the end of the period you’ve paid for.</li>
                    <li>We hate spam as much as you do. If you want, you can turn off any notifications, emails and newsletters from busuu at any time. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We hope you enjoy our services and that you improve your language skills with busuu!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2 class="h4">TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>

                        <br>
                    </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The basic version of the Service can be used completely free of charge. However, you have the option to subscribe to a Premium membership in order to get access to additional learning functionalities (such as grammar material, video lessons, etc.) on the Site.&nbsp;You also have the option to purchase other services or materials (such as live lessons and business courses) whether or not you have a Premium membership.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>The prices and the related terms for all Paid Services, including the Premium membership, are governed by the Paid Services terms set out in clause 4 below.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Where a free-trial period is included, you will not be charged until the free period is over. At this point your card will automatically be charged using the card details entered at the beginning of the trial. There are no refunds or credits for partial monthly subscriptions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="h4">IV. PAID SERVICES</h3>

Where there is any conflict between this clause 4 and the other terms set out in these Terms of Service, the terms in this clause 4 will prevail. The following terms shall apply to you whether or not you are the individual using the Paid Service or if you are a third party facilitating and/or paying on behalf of an individual (such as a student, employee, agent, contractor or other representative) to use the Paid Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing if you are using the Paid Service pursuant to an agreement entered into by busuu and a third party paying for and/or facilitating your use of the Paid Service then where the terms below are in conflict with the terms of the agreement entered into by busuu and the third party the terms of such agreement shall prevail.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The ordering process for Paid Services on the Site allows you to check your order before you proceed with your purchase: please check the details of the order before you proceed to payment. We will send you a confirmation email each time that you purchase a Paid Service. The contract between you and busuu for the relevant Paid Service, which is subject to these Paid Services Terms, is formed at the time we send such confirmation email.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>By placing an order, you agree to pay the stipulated fees (which may be separately agreed with busuu) for the relevant Paid Service(s) by credit card or any other form of payment accepted by busuu, along with the VAT (if applicable) and any other fees or amounts associated with such Paid Service(s). The most recent fees for each Paid Service are set out here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.busuu.com/en/premium#premium-plans">www.busuu.com/premium</a> and you acknowledge and agree that such fees may change from time to time. Any price changes will be announced on the busuu website and will not affect existing subscriptions (so if you have signed up for a membership for a certain price, price changes won’t affect your existing subscription, and will only apply to any future subscription purchase).
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <li>In relation to Paid Services that are offered on a subscription basis, busuu offers different subscription periods so that you can choose the one that best meets your needs.

                    </li>
                    <li>Where a subscription-based Paid Service renews automatically, your credit card will be charged automatically at the end of your current subscription period and your subscription will, unless you cancel it, be renewed for the same period of time. Subscriptions do not expire during the subscription period due to non-use of the subscribed Paid Service. You can check on the length of your subscription at any time by viewing your account information or going to "Settings" and then “Subscription” within the Site.
                        <br>

However if you have used the Paid Service prior to exercising your cancellation right then you must pay for the value of the Paid Service provided up to the date of cancellation.
                        <br>

                    <li>Waiver and severability of terms. The failure of busuu to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.

You agree that these Terms of Service represent the entire understanding between you and busuu in respect of your relationship with busuu as a User (except in respect of Paid Services, which are governed by the Paid Services Terms in addition to these Terms of Service). These Terms of Service supersede any previous agreements between you and busuu including any previous version of these Terms of Service.
